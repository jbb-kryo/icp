## OpenChat SDK Integration

Messagr leverages the Internet Computer's OpenChat SDK to provide enhanced message querying capabilities across platforms.

### How It Works

1. **Message Indexing**: Messages from all platforms are normalized and stored in a unified format
2. **Query Processing**: When a user submits a natural language query, it is:
   - Parsed for filters and structured intent
   - Mapped to retrievable messages
   - Processed through the OpenChat AI to identify semantically relevant content

3. **Cross-Platform Understanding**: The integration understands context across different messaging platforms

### Query Examples

Users can ask natural language questions such as:

- "Find messages about project deadlines from Slack last week"
- "Show me all attachments shared in WhatsApp conversations with Alice"
- "What did the marketing team discuss about the new campaign on Discord?"
- "When was the last time someone mentioned the quarterly report?"

### Technical Implementation

The OpenChat SDK integration works through inter-canister calls to the OpenChat Community canister. This provides:

- Advanced natural language understanding
- Semantic search rather than simple keyword matching
- Cross-platform context awareness
- Efficient retrieval from large message volumes

### Privacy and Security

All message content stays within your own canister, with only anonymized query requests sent to OpenChat:

- No raw message content is shared with the OpenChat service
- All sensitive user information is stripped before processing
- Results are scored and filtered within your canister

## Advanced Query Filters

Messagr supports a sophisticated query filtering system:

| Filter Type | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Platform | "from Slack" or "on Discord" |
| Time | "last week" or "yesterday" or "before May" |
| Person | "from Alice" or "with marketing team" |
| Content | "containing budget" or "with attachments" |
| Conversation | "in the general channel" |

Multiple filters can be combined: "Find messages from Bob on Telegram containing project update from last month"

## Message Analytics

In addition to searching, you can analyze communication patterns:

- Response times across platforms
- Message volume by platform and time
- Topic distribution in conversations
- Engagement metrics for team communication

This functionality leverages the OpenChat SDK's analytical capabilities alongside custom processing in the canister.
